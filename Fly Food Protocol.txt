Directions:


1. If making vials, check with the Sullivan lab about their drosofiller, and confirm with someone (not an undergraduate volunteer) that it is ok to borrow. 
2. Sign in to the timekeeping booklet in room 304 in Sinsheimer. 
3. Add yeast and soy flour to bucket 1 and corn meal and agar to bucket 2
4. In the fume hood measure out the propionic acid and double parafilm the top to seal it.
5. Bring all equipment and ingredients into the kitchen (Sinsheimer 304). 
6. Make sure the valve at the bottom of the kettle is sealed, as otherwise the water will just pour out. 
7. Add 10/5/2.5 L of water to the kettle and turn it on. BE CAREFUL - THE STEAM CAN BURN YOU. USE HEAT-RESISTANT GLOVES WHEN OPENING OR INTERACTING WITH THE KETTLE.
8. Once water in kettle has come to a boil add bucket 1 while mixing the kettle. Now, use your wooden spoon to mix bucket 2 and continue mixing as you pour it in the kettle. NOTE: Continue to mix the kettle thoroughly throughout the cooking process to prevent corn meal from falling to the bottom and forming clumps. 
9. Add corn syrup and continue to mix. Fill the corn syrup bottle with water and shake to get the last bits of syrup out and pour it in as you cook.
10. Cook for approx. 10 minutes while stirring regularly. Fish out any clumps that you find with your spoon. 
11. Turn heat off and let stand for 1 minute.
12. Put gloves back on, open the door and get ready to add the propionic acid. The smell can be harsh for some people, so before opening the parafilm take a big breath. Add the propionic acid and stir well. Cover up the kettle with the lid and breathe easy. 
13. Let stand another approx. 15 minutes, until the food is at about 55 degrees Celsius, and add the tegosept. 


Pouring food:
1. Check that the drosofiller is still warm. If not: empty it and fill it back up with hot water; otherwise, dump out as much water as possible and place on counter. 
2. Pour food into the graduated bucket about a third to halfway full. 
3. Pour food into the drosofiller well and place a tray of vials into the compartment. Make sure you do this correctly - there is only one direction the tray will go into the drosofiller, and if inserted incorrectly it can catch on the far side, not lining up the holes correctly with the middle of each vial. 
4. Place the now-filled tray on the counter and cover with the cheesecloth.
5. Continue until enough vials have been filled. 
6. To pour bottles, simple take the graduated bucket and pour into bottles up to the 50 mL mark. Place these under the cheesecloth as well. 
7. Any extra food can be poured into a tupperware or similar container, covered with plastic wrap, and stored in the refrigerated room (Sinsheimer 141). 


Cleaning:
1. Fill the dirty drosofiller with warm water and and scrub away the food. Make sure no food is stuck in the holes. 
2. Fill up one big bucket with water and put the other one beneath the spigot. 
3. Pour water into kettle and use brush to scrub off the food from sides of kettle. 
4. When water becomes too murky pour it out into the other bucket and dump.
5. Repeat until clean.


Packing food (The next day):


1. Place an empty tray on top of a tray of food and flip it over so that vials are now facedown in the new tray. Pushing down on carefully on the exact center of the cardboard grid with the tip of a finger should keep it situated such that it keeps the vials from falling over or becoming disorganized. 
2. Use a sharpie to mark the tray of food with the day’s date. 
3. For bottles simply plug them (with bottle plugs, of course), and store them 16 to a flat. 
4. Food can now go in the refrigerated room (Sinsheimer 304) and can last ~ 3 weeks.
